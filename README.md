# schedule_template

I've long used composition notebooks as daily planners.  Although it 
can be calming to lay everything out by hand, I thought I could 
expedite a bit of the process by printing pages.  I used this as an 
opportunity to tinker with ChatGPT.  The result is the LaTeX class and 
corresponding Python driver.

I printed on standard copy paper, trimmed the sides by 1/2 in, trimmed 
the top and bottom by 3/4 in, and bound using a plastic coil.

Desiderata:

  - populate known schedule items
  - indicate special dates (birthdays, etc.)
  - Update short form (T -> Tu and Th, S -> Sa and Su)
  - Prologue and Appendices, as desired.
  - Month-level organization.
  - Calendar.
  - Font/color/etc. options.
